Malaria In Academic City
 What Is Malaria ?
Malaria is an acute febrile illness caused by Plasmodium parasites, transmitted through the bites of
infected female Anopheles mosquitoes. It primarily affects tropical countries and is preventable
and curable if diagnosed and treated promptly. The disease is not contagious and is spread
exclusively through mosquito bites. There are five species of parasites that can cause malaria in
humans, with Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax posing the greatest threat.
Causes of Malaria In Academic City
Malaria is prevalent in Academic City, primarily due to the dense vegetation surrounding the school
premises, particularly around the hostel area. The abundance of bushes and foliage creates ideal
breeding grounds for mosquitoes, especially during the rainy seasons when stagnant water
accumulates, further exacerbating the risk of malaria transmission.
The absence of mosquito control devices on campus exacerbates the malaria risk. Additionally,
classrooms provided for post-class and late-night studying lack air conditioning and feature large
windows. Closing these windows to mitigate mosquito entry would result in discomfort due to the
heat, while leaving them open increases the likelihood of mosquito infiltration.
Symptoms of Malaria
Malaria symptoms typically manifest in stages and can vary in severity. Here's an overview:
1.
Early Symptoms (Prodromal Phase):
●
Fever: Often the first and most common symptom, it may come and go in cycles.
●
Chills: Usually accompany the fever and can be severe.
●
Headaches: Often intense and may be accompanied by body aches.
●
Fatigue: Feeling very tired or weak is common.
●
Sweating: Profuse sweating, particularly during fever episodes.
2.
Paroxysm (Acute Phase):
●
During this phase, fever becomes more pronounced and occurs in cycles, usually
every 24 to 48 hours, depending on the type of malaria parasite.
●
Fever spikes can be accompanied by severe chills and sweating.
3.
Complications (Severe Malaria):
●
If left untreated or in cases of severe infection, malaria can progress to
life-threatening complications, such as:
●
Cerebral Malaria: Severe malaria affecting the brain, leading to seizures,
confusion, coma, and neurological damage.
 ●
Severe Anemia: Destruction of red blood cells, leading to fatigue, weakness,
and potentially organ damage.
●
Organ Failure: Malaria can affect multiple organs, including the kidneys,
liver, and lungs, leading to organ failure.
●
Respiratory Distress: Fluid accumulation in the lungs, causing difficulty
breathing.
●
Hypoglycemia: Low blood sugar levels, leading to weakness, confusion, and
loss of consciousness.
●
Jaundice: Yellowing of the skin and eyes due to liver dysfunction.
It's essential to note that malaria symptoms can mimic those of other illnesses, making diagnosis
challenging without proper testing. If you experience symptoms suggestive of malaria, especially if
you've been in malaria-endemic areas, it's crucial to seek medical attention promptly for diagnosis
and treatment.
Prevention of Malaria in Academic City
Preventing malaria in Academic City involves several proactive measures:
1.
Mosquito Nets: Students residing in rooms equipped only with fans should acquire
mosquito nets to protect themselves while sleeping. These nets act as a physical barrier,
preventing mosquitoes from biting and transmitting the malaria parasite.
2.
Utilize Classrooms with Nets: Whenever possible, students should opt to study in
classrooms that are equipped with nets on the windows. These nets serve as an additional
barrier against mosquito entry, reducing the risk of malaria transmission during study
sessions.
3.
Mosquito Repellents: Students should make use of mosquito repellents to further deter
mosquito bites, especially when spending time outdoors or in areas prone to mosquito
activity. Applying repellents containing DEET or picaridin like Medisoft Mosquito Repelent
can effectively repel mosquitoes for several hours.

activity. Applying repellents containing DEET or picaridin like Medisoft Mosquito Repelent

4.
Mosquito Sprays: Mosquito sprays are made available in the hostels for on-campus
students. These sprays can be used to eliminate mosquitoes within living spaces, reducing
the risk of bites and malaria transmission. Students can request access to mosquito sprays
from the Hostel Coordinators for use as needed.
By implementing these preventive measures, students can significantly reduce their risk of
contracting malaria and contribute to maintaining a healthier living environment within Academic
City.
Treatment of Malaria
Absolutely, seeking prompt medical attention from the Acity clinic or another reputable health
center is crucial upon noticing signs and symptoms of malaria. It's vital to avoid self-medication by
 taking malaria drugs without a prescription, as improper use of medication can lead to drug
resistance and other complications.
Visiting a health center that is aware of one's medical records is advantageous as it allows
healthcare providers to make informed decisions regarding diagnosis and treatment. Having access
to medical history can aid in identifying any underlying conditions, allergies, or previous episodes
of malaria, enabling tailored and effective management of the illness.
Overall, timely and professional medical care is essential in managing malaria effectively and
preventing the progression of the disease to severe complications.
