Illicit Drug Use and Abuse In Academic City Campus
 What is meant by Use and Abuse of Illicit Drugs
Illicit drug use and abuse refer to the consumption and misuse of illegal or controlled substances, often
leading to physical and psychological dependence. Overall, addressing illicit drug use and abuse requires
a comprehensive approach that addresses both the physical and psychological aspects of addiction.
Here's a breakdown of what this entails:
1. Physical Dependence:
●
Physical dependence occurs when the body adapts to the presence of a drug and requires
increasing amounts to achieve the desired effects. This phenomenon is known as tolerance.
●
Tolerance leads to the need for higher doses of the drug over time to achieve the same effects as
initially experienced.
●
When drug use is discontinued or significantly reduced, withdrawal symptoms may occur. These
symptoms can vary depending on the type of drug but can include heart palpitations, seizures,
nausea, sweating, and anxiety.
2. Psychological Dependence:
●
Psychological dependence refers to the emotional and mental reliance on a drug to cope with
daily life or to feel a sense of normalcy.
●
Users may feel an intense craving or urge to use the drug, even when they are aware of its
negative consequences.

The drug may become central to their thoughts, behaviors, and routines, leading to prioritization
of drug use over other responsibilities, such as work, relationships, and personal health.

Individuals with illicit substance abuse disorders often experience adverse effects on their
physical health, mental well-being, relationships, and overall quality of life.

their substance abuse on their own.
4. Relapse Prevention:

Relapse is common in addiction recovery but can be minimized through ongoing support,
therapy, and relapse prevention strategies.

Learning to identify triggers, developing healthy coping mechanisms, and maintaining a strong
support network are essential for long-term sobriety.
