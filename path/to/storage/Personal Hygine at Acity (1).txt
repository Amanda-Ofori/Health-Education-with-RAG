 Personal Hygiene in University Settings: Essentials for Maintaining
Health and Well-being
Personal hygiene is an essential aspect of everyday life, particularly in communal living and
learning environments like universities. This comprehensive guide, drawing from the lecture
notes provided by Jimma University in collaboration with the Ethiopia Public Health Training
Initiative, highlights the importance of maintaining personal hygiene in university settings to
ensure the health and well-being of students.
Understanding Personal Hygiene
Personal hygiene refers to maintaining the cleanliness of one’s body and clothing to prevent
disease and keep oneself looking and feeling good. In the context of a university, where
students are in close quarters in classrooms, dormitories, and cafeterias, the importance of
personal hygiene cannot be overstated. Effective hygiene practices help break the transmission
cycle of diseases, which is crucial in preventing outbreaks of illnesses that can disrupt academic
progress and campus life.
Critical Areas of Personal Hygiene
1. Hand Hygiene: Hands are the primary vehicle for transmitting pathogens. Regular hand
washing with soap before meals, after using the restroom, and after any form of contamination
(like handling dirty equipment) is crucial. Recognizing the paramount importance of hand
hygiene in preventing the transmission of pathogens, Acity University has ensured that
adequate facilities and resources for proper hand washing are readily available throughout the
campus. This includes sinks with soap and water, and alcohol-based hand sanitizers containing
60-80% alcohol positioned at strategic locations. Students and staff are encouraged to wash
their hands frequently, especially after touching commonly used surfaces like door handles.
Detailed hand hygiene protocols are available through the nurse’s office, which can be
contacted via email for more information.
2. Oral Hygiene: Maintaining oral hygiene is vital to avoid dental issues, which can be
distressing and distracting from studies. Students should brush at least twice a day and use
dental floss to prevent gum disease and other oral health problems. Universities can support
this by providing dental check-ups as part of their health services.
3. Bathing and Body Hygiene: Regular showering is necessary to remove dirt and odors,
especially for students involved in physical activities or those living in close communal settings.
Ensuring that shower facilities are clean, safe, and well-maintained is a responsibility that
university administrations should take seriously.
4. Foot Hygiene: Many fungal infections are contracted from communal shower areas (both
on-campus hostel and off-campus hostels). Students should be encouraged to wear shower
shoes in communal showers and to keep their feet clean and dry.
 5. Clothing: Clean clothes prevent skin infections and contribute to a person’s overall sense of
well-being. Students should take advantage of the various laundry facilities on campus such as
the Laundry Service at the Rec Centre, the Hostel cleaning staff, and self-laundry by using the
tap area and dry-line area.
6. Cleaning of Campus Facilities: Acity University has established rigorous cleaning protocols
to ensure that all areas of the campus, including workstations, lecture halls, and other facilities,
are kept clean and tidy. Regular cleaning and disinfection of these areas are carried out,
focusing on high-touch surfaces to minimize the risk of virus transmission.
Promoting Personal Hygiene Education
Education plays a pivotal role in ensuring students understand and implement good hygiene
practices. Orientation sessions for new students can include segments on personal hygiene,
emphasizing its impact on health and social interactions. Regular health campaigns and posters
can reinforce these messages.
Hygiene and Mental Health

can reinforce these messages.
Hygiene and Mental Health
Personal hygiene also impacts mental health. A clean and well-groomed appearance can boost
self-esteem and reduce stress, leading to a more productive and engaging university
experience. Counseling and wellness services should integrate discussions about the link
between personal hygiene and mental health in their sessions.
Conclusion
Maintaining high standards of personal hygiene in universities is not just about preventing
diseases; it’s also about fostering an environment conducive to learning and personal
development. Acity University's hygiene policies are integral to ensuring that the campus
remains a safe environment conducive to learning and personal development. These measures
are continuously reviewed and updated in response to the evolving public health guidelines and
the needs of the university community. By adhering to these policies, students, faculty, and staff
contribute to the collective effort of maintaining a healthy campus.
